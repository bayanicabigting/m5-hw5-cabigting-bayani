# AUDIT A11Y CHANGES:
WAVE was used to check for accessibility issues.
- WAVE detected out-of-order/skipped heading sequences, which may affect screen readers.Changed “Internet Andrea” heading from h3 to h1. Also changed color to #FA5A5A.
- Changed subsequent h3 headings to h2.
- WAVE detected no labels for input forms, so screen readers would not be able to describe them. Added aria labels to name, email, and message form text boxes.
- WAVE recommended a more structured, clearly labeled separated sections. Added header, main, and footer sections to index.html.
- WAVE detected low contrast text colors. Changed nav and footer text color to white, body text color to #1A1A1A.
- H1 text seemed kind of small. Changed .hero h1 font size to 60px.
